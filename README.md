# 🎮 Super Mario Bros AI - PPO Reinforcement Learning  

This project implements **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** to train an AI agent to play **Super Mario Bros** using reinforcement learning. The agent learns to navigate the game using a reward-based system, improving its gameplay over time.  


## 📌 Features  

✅ **Trained using PPO** - A state-of-the-art RL algorithm  
✅ **Implemented in Jupyter Notebook** - Easy to follow and modify  
✅ **CPU-based training** - 50,000 steps took ~1.5 hours  
✅ **Scaling up soon** - Plan to train on **Google Colab + GPU** for better performance  
✅ **Gym Super Mario Environment** - Uses OpenAI Gym for game simulation  


## 🤖 Technologies Used  

- 🏆 **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)**  
- 🎮 **OpenAI Gym Super Mario Bros Environment**  
- 🐍 **Python & Jupyter Notebook**  
- 🧠 **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**
