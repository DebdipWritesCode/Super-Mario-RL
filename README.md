ðŸš€ Super Mario Bros AI - PPO Reinforcement Learning ðŸŽ® This project uses Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to train an AI agent to play Super Mario Bros through reinforcement learning. Currently trained on CPU (50,000 steps in 1.5 hours), but will be scaled up using Google Colab + GPU for better performance.
